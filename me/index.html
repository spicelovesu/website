          I'm a newbie computer engineer and developer, currently fully fluent in DBD.js and Aoi.js, and a newbie at Javascript. I've made a very small name for myself in the Krunker community, as I'm currently a wiki moderator/editor for the game (https://krunkerio.fandom.com/wiki/User:Sunspice)

        Making a huge Minecraft map and server has always been one of my dreams, and is where im starting my programming journey. You can take a look at my progress through the button below, the map is coming along quite nicely. Aside from minecraft, I have experience with the Discord API, as I've<br></br>made operational economy, moderation, and RPG game bots each with unique features. These don't exist anymore, as I've put Discord developing down for the time being. Finally, I code this website as well as everything else on a Raspberry Pi 4 (Debian 11), with just VSCode for now.
